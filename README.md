# Philippines vACC Knowledge Base
The central learning repository of observers, controllers, and pilots flying in and out of the Philippine Airspace This was inspired by [Gander Oceanic](https://github.com/czqo) through their knowledge base site, which was made through the open-source documentation of [MkDocs](https://github.com/squidfunk/mkdocs-material) primarily developed by Martin Donath ([squidfunk](https://github.com/squidfunk)).

This is a reference guide to the procedures and systems used by the Philippine Airspace and the Manila Area Control Center (ACC). As per the quest to improve all of the lesson-based materials within our vACC, we proudly inform everyone that this repository will be open-source and, thus, editing of files for the mere reason of development is very much encouraged.

Kindly take note that the whole page is still **under construction** and should not be used for the time being until we complete the necessary competencies set out in each section. If you would like to request or add details within a topic, feel free to open it [here](https://github.com/vatsimph/learn/issues).

Also, this page doesn't collect any information on your system, nor does it use any 3rd Party Analytic Providers to trace the statistics of the site or its visitors. In any case, all of the pages connected to the domain of ```vatphil.com``` comply with its local privacy and data protection policy, which can be accessed [here](https://vatphil.com/privacy-policy).
