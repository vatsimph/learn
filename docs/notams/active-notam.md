# Active NOTAMs in Manila FIR

This channel is created to inform our pilots and controllers regarding the latest **Notice to Airmen** (NOTAM) releases taking place on airports within the **Manila Area Control Center** (ACC) and **Flight Information Region** (FIR).

For controllers, you may do add these things to your ATIS, while controlling. This NOTAMS is updated once in a while, if there are any significant temporary changes that needs to be applied.
