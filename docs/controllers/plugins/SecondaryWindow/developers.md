# Secondary Window (Developers)

## File layout

| File                          | Purpose                                                                 |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `SecondaryWindowMap.txt`      | Map definitions: colors, polygons, lines, polylines, labels.            |
| `SecondaryWindowSettings.txt` | Visual settings: background, dots, fonts, tag format, `SCT_FILE:`, etc. |
| `SecondaryWindowState.txt`    | Auto saved window state                                                 |

### Commands

```
.sw reload
```

---

## Map file (`SecondaryWindowMap.txt`)

Plain text. Each line is a directive: `KEY:value...`. 
Coordinates use TopSky format: `hemisphere + DDD.MM.SS.fff`,
e.g. `N014.30.00.000`

### Colors

Declare named colors once near the top, then reference by name:

```
COLORDEF:Black:0:0:0
```

### Map blocks

Every map starts with `MAP:`. Everything that follows belongs to that map
until the next `MAP:` directive.

```
MAP:RPLL:A                 // required — display name
FOLDER:CTR                 // optional — grouping label
ACTIVE:1                   // optional — 0 hides on load, 1 shows (default)
COLOR:Blue                 // sets the active color
```

`COLOR:` can be issued multiple times inside a map to change color
between shapes.

### Shapes

Three closed/open variants, all the syntax Ground Radar / TopSky use:

| Directive                                   | Behavior                                                      |
| ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `COORDTYPE:OTHER:REGION` + `COORD:` lines   | **Filled** closed area                                        |
| `COORDTYPE:OTHER:POLYGON` + `COORD:` lines  | **Outline only** closed shape (last vertex connects to first) |
| `COORDTYPE:OTHER:POLYLINE` + `COORD:` lines | Open line strip, no closing segment                           |
| ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `COORDTYPE:OTHER:REGION` + `COORD:` lines   | **Filled** closed area                                        |
| `COORDTYPE:OTHER:POLYGON` + `COORD:` lines  | **Outline only** closed shape (last vertex connects to first) |
| `COORDTYPE:OTHER:POLYLINE` + `COORD:` lines | Open line strip, no closing segment                           |

Each shape ends at the next `COORDTYPE:`, `MAP:`, or end of file.

```
// Filled area:
COORDTYPE:OTHER:REGION
COORD:N014.30.00.000:E120.30.00.000
COORD:N014.30.00.000:E121.30.00.000
COORD:N015.30.00.000:E121.30.00.000
COORD:N015.30.00.000:E120.30.00.000

// no fill:
COORDTYPE:OTHER:POLYGON
COORD:N014.37.36.529:E120.59.29.134
COORD:N014.37.35.053:E120.59.48.519
... more coords ...

// Approach arc with no closing line:
COORDTYPE:OTHER:POLYLINE
COORD:N014.28.29.254:E121.05.29.662
COORD:N014.28.24.532:E121.05.27.335
... more coords ...
```

Other:

```
POLYGON
COORD:N..:E..
COORD:N..:E..
ENDPOLYGON
```

### Single line segments

For one off straight lines without setting up a polyline block:

```
LINE:N014.30.00.000:E120.30.00.000:N014.30.00.000:E121.30.00.000
//   ^from-lat       ^from-lon       ^to-lat         ^to-lon
```

### Text labels

Drops a label at a geographic coordinate in the current color:

```
TEXT:N014.34.35.000:E120.54.02.800:2000ft
TEXT:N014.42.05.500:E121.06.55.600:2500ft
TEXT:N014.35.50.679:E120.59.24.237:5500ft
```

#### Per-section label size

Use `TEXT_SIZE:` to set the font size (in pixels) for every `TEXT:` and
inline ESE label that follows. It sticks until the next `TEXT_SIZE:`
directive. Use `TEXT_SIZE:0` to reset to the global default
(`LABEL_FONT_SIZE` in settings).

```
TEXT_SIZE:18
TEXT:N014.30.00.000:E121.00.00.000:RPLL TWR

TEXT_SIZE:10
TEXT:N014.30.45.000:E121.00.30.000:Bay 18
TEXT:N014.30.46.000:E121.00.32.000:Bay 19

TEXT_SIZE:0     // back to default
```

The font face and bold are configured globally in
`SecondaryWindowSettings.txt` (see `LABEL_FONT_FACE` / `LABEL_FONT_BOLD`).

### Importing labels from `.ese` files

EuroScope `.ese` label format is `lat:lon:category:label`, e.g.

```
N014.30.53.908:E121.00.32.721:RPLL BAYS-GroundLayout:61
N014.31.10.449:E121.00.44.997:RPLL BAYS-GroundLayout:115
```

Relative paths resolve against the map file's folder. Absolute paths
work too. Add as many `INCLUDE_ESE:` lines as you want.


```
.sw ese "C:\.ese"
```

it will skips lines starting with `;` (ESE comments)
or `[` (section headers like `[FREETEXT]`), so you can point it at a full
`.ese` file with many sections and it'll just pick out the label formated
lines. Imported labels render in white by default.

**Text Size** 
Put `TEXT_SIZE:#` before the coords to apply that pixel size to everything that follows.

```
TEXT_SIZE:8
N014.30.53.908:E121.00.32.721:RPLL BAYS-GroundLayout:61
N014.31.10.449:E121.00.44.997:RPLL BAYS-GroundLayout:115

TEXT_SIZE:0      // reset to default
```

---

## Importing `.sct` / `.sct2` sector files

Standard EuroScope sector files can be merged straight into the maps menu
— no need to translate them into the plugin's own map format.

Add one line per file to **`SecondaryWindowSettings.txt`**:

```
SCT_FILE:xxxx.sct
```

**What gets imported?**

| `.sct` section | Becomes                                                    | Folder       |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| `[ARTCC]`      | One toggle per boundary name (polyline)                    | `ARTCC`      |
| `[ARTCC HIGH]` | One toggle per boundary name (polyline)                    | `ARTCC HIGH` |
| `[ARTCC LOW]`  | One toggle per boundary name (polyline)                    | `ARTCC LOW`  |
| `[SID]`        | One toggle per procedure (polyline)                        | `SID`        |
| `[STAR]`       | One toggle per procedure (polyline)                        | `STAR`       |
| `[GEO]`        | One toggle per `;comment` group above a run of lines       | `GEO`        |
| `[REGIONS]`    | One toggle per named region (filled polygon)               | `REGIONS`    |
| `[FIXES]`      | All fixes collapse into one `FIXES` toggle (symbol + name) | (root)       |

Other sections (`[INFO]`, `[VOR]`, `[NDB]`, `[AIRPORT]`, `[RUNWAY]`,
airways, `[LABELS]`) are parsed and discarded for now (I might add them in
the future).

### Waypoints (fixes)

The `[FIXES]` section of a sector file lists navigation fixes as
`NAME LAT LON`, for example:

```
[FIXES]
ALGAD N013.11.08.498 E123.55.19.199
```

Every fix in the file lands in a single layer called `FIXES`. It starts
hidden like the rest of the SCT imports, so open the sidebar and tick
`FIXES` to show them. Each fix draws as a small triangle with its name
beside it. The symbol and name share one color you set with
`WAYPOINT_COLOR`, and `WAYPOINT_SIZE` controls how big the triangle is.

```
WAYPOINT_COLOR:120:160:200     // R:G:B of the symbol and label
WAYPOINT_SIZE:4                // px, half height of the triangle
```

---

## Settings file (`SecondaryWindowSettings.txt`)

Same `KEY:value` syntax. Any key you omit falls back to the built-in default.

### Background

```
BACKGROUND_COLOR:0:0:0       // R:G:B of the map area
```

### Window

All R:G:B. Omit any line to keep the built-in default.

```
BORDER_COLOR:40:40:40          // Outline around the window
TITLE_BAR_COLOR:80:80:80       // Title Bar
TITLE_TEXT_COLOR:220:220:220   // "Secondary Window" text
```

### Map rendering

```
LINE_WIDTH:1                   // pixels, applies to lines, outlines, polylines
FILL_POLYGONS:true             // true = filled regions are filled; false = outline only
```

### Label font (TEXT + inline ESE labels)

Per section overrides via `TEXT_SIZE:n` in the map file take precedence.

```
LABEL_FONT_FACE:Consolas
LABEL_FONT_SIZE:12             // pixel height
LABEL_FONT_BOLD:false
```

### Traffic dots + trails

```
TRAFFIC_DOT_COLOR:255:255:0    // dot color
TRAFFIC_DOT_RADIUS:3           // px (half width of the square dot)
TRAFFIC_TRAIL_LENGTH:5         // number of historical positions to draw (0 = off)
```

The trail is a row of dots behind each aircraft, same size and color as the
main dot. The plugin records each target's last `TRAFFIC_TRAIL_LENGTH`
positions and renders them every frame. Set to `0` to disable.

### Tags (labels next to each dot)

```
SHOW_TAGS:true
TAG_COLOR:255:255:0
TAG_FONT_FACE:Consolas
TAG_FONT_SIZE:12               // pixel height
TAG_FONT_BOLD:false
TAG_OFFSET_X:5                 // px from dot center (positive = right)
TAG_OFFSET_Y:-3                // px from dot center (negative = up)
TAG_CLICK_WIDTH:80             // width of the clickable/hover area for the callsign
TAG_CLICK_HEIGHT:14
TAG_BACKGROUND:false           // true draws a filled box behind every tag
TAG_BG_COLOR:0:0:0             // R:G:B of that box
TAG_BG_PADDING:2               // px of fill around the text on each side
TAG_BACKGROUND_HOVER:false     // true shows the box only on the tag under the cursor
```

#### Tag background

`TAG_BACKGROUND` puts a solid color box behind the tag text so callsigns stay
readable over busy ground layouts. `TAG_BG_COLOR` sets that color, and
`TAG_BG_PADDING` controls how far the fill reaches past the text on each side.

`TAG_BACKGROUND_HOVER` is the lighter option. Tags stay transparent until you
move the mouse over one, and only that tag gets the box. Use it on its own for a
clean look that highlights whatever you point at, or alongside `TAG_BACKGROUND`
for an always on fill. Both modes share `TAG_BG_COLOR`.

### Tag content

The text shown next to each aircraft dot is built from one or more
`TAG_LINE:` entries, in order. Each is a format string with
`{placeholder}` tokens. **You can add as many `TAG_LINE:` entries as you
want — each becomes a new line** in the tag.

```
TAG_LINE:{callsign}
TAG_LINE:{type} {alt} {cfl}
TAG_LINE:{gs}kt {hdg}
TAG_LINE:{scratch}
```

That gives every tag four lines:
```
PAL123
A320 19000/24000
200kt 045
BAY105
```

If no `TAG_LINE:` is declared, the tag falls back to a single line showing
just `{callsign}`.

#### Placeholder reference

Position / radar data (always available):

| Placeholder  | What it shows                                                         |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |

| `{trend}`    | Vertical trend arrow: `^` climbing, `v` descending, blank when level  |

Flight-plan / controller-assigned data (empty if no flight plan correlated):

| Placeholder | What it shows                                                                           |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `{type}`    | Aircraft ICAO type (e.g. `A320`, `B738`)                                                |
| `{wtc}`     | Wake turbulence category letter (`L`, `M`, `H`, `J`)                                    |
| `{cfl}`     | Cleared altitude as 3-digit FL (`240` = 24 000 ft, `030` = 3 000 ft). Empty if not set. |
| `{cflft}`   | Cleared altitude in raw feet                                                            |
| `{asquawk}` | Assigned (not necessarily set yet) squawk code                                          |
| `{spd}`     | Assigned speed                                                                          |
| `{ahdg}`    | Assigned heading                                                                        |
| `{scratch}` | Controller scratchpad string                                                            |
| `{dep}`     | Departure airport (origin)                                                              |
| `{arr}`     | Arrival airport (destination)                                                           |
| `{sid}`     | SID name                                                                                |
| `{star}`    | STAR name                                                                               |
| `{rwy}`     | Departure runway                                                                        |
| `{arrwy}`   | Arrival runway                                                                          |
| `{rfl}`     | Requested cruising level as FL                                                          |

Anything between `{` and `}` that isn't a known placeholder is echoed back
literally, so typos are visible (`{calsign}` shows as `{calsign}` in the
tag). Any text outside `{...}` is rendered literally.

#### Example tag formats

Minimal callsign-only (the default if you set nothing):

```
TAG_LINE:{callsign}
```

Compact ATC-style:

```
TAG_LINE:{callsign} {squawk}
TAG_LINE:{fl} {gs}
```

Full IFR clearance summary:

```
TAG_LINE:{callsign}
TAG_LINE:{type} {dep}-{arr}
TAG_LINE:{fl}/{cfl} {gs}kt
TAG_LINE:{scratch}
```

Ground-radar-ish (squawk + scratchpad first):

```
TAG_LINE:{callsign} {squawk}
TAG_LINE:{scratch}
TAG_LINE:{rwy} {sid}
```

## Multiple Secondary Windows

Up to **5** Secondary Windows can be open at once. Each has its own
position, size, view (pan/zoom), altitude filter, and **per-window** map
visibility — so you can have one window showing the ground layout for a
particular airport and another showing the TMA, without affecting either.

| How to open another           | What you get                                                                     |
| ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Sidebar → **Open new window** | New window starts **with all maps hidden** so you can pick exactly what to show. |
| `.sw new` chat command        | Same as above.                                                                   |

The first window at plugin load seeds its visibility from the `ACTIVE:`
flags in the map file (and from any saved `HIDE:` lines in
`SecondaryWindowState.txt`). New windows opened during the session start
blank by design — opening a new window almost always means "I want a
different view," not "show me everything again."

---

## Loading from EuroScope `.asr` files

Open the sidebar and click **Load .asr** to bring up a Windows file
picker. Pick any EuroScope `.asr` and the window's visible-map set is
replaced with whatever that `.asr` had on:

- Maps mentioned in the `.asr` and *also* loaded in our `MapCollection`
  → become visible in this window
- Anything else → hidden in this window

The window then refits its view to fit the new selection. Other windows
are untouched — each window can load a different `.asr`.

The plugin recognises these `.asr` section prefixes (case-insensitive):

```
ARTCC boundary:        ARTCC high boundary:        ARTCC low boundary:
ARTCC:                 ARTCC high:                 ARTCC low:
Airports:              Fixes:                      Free Text:
Geo:                   Regions:                    Runways:
Sids:                  Stars:
VORs:                  NDBs:
Low airway:            High airway:
```

Lines from any other prefix (display config, plugin properties, window
position, etc.) are ignored.

**Name matching:** the second `:` separated field of each line is the map
name. `Free Text:` entries strip everything after the first backslash
(so `Free Text:RPLL TWY-GroundLayout\C:freetext` matches a map named
`RPLL TWY-GroundLayout`). Comparison is case-insensitive.

---

## Window state persistence (`SecondaryWindowState.txt`)

The plugin auto-saves your window layout on unload and restores it at
startup. **You normally never touch this file**, it's the persisted form
of every position drag, resize, view pan/zoom, map toggle, and altitude
filter change.

**What survives a restart, per window:**

- Screen position + size
- Collapsed-to-title-bar state
- View center (lat/lon) and zoom (nm/px)
- Altitude filter (inherit / explicit min/max)
- The set of maps hidden in this window

**Format** (line based, one `WINDOW` block per open window):

```
WINDOW
POS:100:100:420:420
COLLAPSED:0
UNCOLLAPSED_H:420
VIEW:14.500000:121.000000:0.500000
ALT:1:-2147483648:2147483647
HIDE:RPLL Groundlayout
HIDE:RPLL Background
```

| Field           | Meaning                                                         |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `POS`           | `x:y:w:h` screen coords, pixels                                 |
| `COLLAPSED`     | `0` / `1`                                                       |
| `UNCOLLAPSED_H` | Height to restore when uncollapsed                              |
| `VIEW`          | `centerLat:centerLon:nmPerPixel`                                |
| `ALT`           | `inherit:minFt:maxFt` (inherit=1 means use file level filter)   |
| `HIDE`          | One per hidden map (visible = absent). Names match `MAP:` names |

Up to 5 `WINDOW` blocks are restored; extras are silently dropped. Lines
starting with `//` and blank lines are ignored.

| Double click then drag in map area | Draw a measuring ruler with distance in NM and bearing. It stays on screen after you let go, until your next left click dismisses it |
| Drag an aircraft callsign          | Move that tag's offset relative to its dot (per aircraft, persists for the session)                                                  |
| Mouse wheel                        | Zoom                                                                                                                                 |

Panning moved to the right mouse button so a left click stays free for tags
and the measuring ruler. The right button no longer opens a popup menu;
everything that used to live there now sits in the sidebar.

### Sidebar

Every control lives in the sidebar now. Click the list button in the title bar
to slide it open. The top shows a row of action buttons, and below that the map
list as a tree grouped by folder (such as `GEO`, `REGIONS`, `ESE`, and per
airport sub folders like `ESE/RPLL`). Tick a map to show it in this window,
untick to hide it. Folders expand and collapse, and your layout is saved per
window.

ESE free text imports nest under `ESE` by aerodrome, so the taxiway and bay
labels for each airport sit under their own `ESE/<ICAO>` folder and each one
has its own toggle.

**Sidebar actions**

| Button                      | Effect                                                                                                   |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Hide all** / **Show all** | Hide or show every map in this window at once                                                            |
| **Load .asr**               | File picker that applies an EuroScope `.asr` visible map list to this window only                        |
| **Altitude filter...**      | Open a dialog for the per window altitude filter (min/max in feet, or "No filter")                       |
| **Hide aircraft on ground** | Toggle skipping slow targets (under about 40 kt) so taxiing and parked aircraft stop cluttering the view |
| **Open new window**         | Spawn another window (up to 5). Starts with all maps hidden.                                             |
| **Reload maps**             | Re-read the map file from disk (also re-imports any `SCT_FILE:` entries)                                 |
| **Reload settings**         | Re-read settings and re-import SCT content                                                               |

When the map area is empty (no maps loaded, or every map hidden in this
window), the window shows a centered hint — **No maps loaded** or
**No maps visible**. The first time you enable a map in a previously-blank
window, the view automatically refits to the map's bounding box so you
see it right away.
