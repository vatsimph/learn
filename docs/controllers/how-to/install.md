The Philippines vACC utilizes Eurocontrol for its Air Traffic Controllers as it can host a system that the real world controllers use (TopSky).

This serves as a training management system for the controllers. It is a centralized system that allows the controllers to manage their training sessions and to manage the sessions that are booked by the controllers.

You may refer to the next session on how to use the booking system.
