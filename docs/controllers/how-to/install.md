# Sector Files

The Philippines vACC utilizes EuroScope for its Air Traffic Controllers as it can host a near 1 to 1 system that the real world controllers use (TopSky).

Currently, only approved controllers may use our sector files.

The VATPHIL Updater is a desktop application that automatically downloads, installs, and keeps your sector files up to date. It handles everything from first-time installation to AIRAC cycle updates.

## Euroscope 

The euroscope [[Download]](https://www.euroscope.hu/wp/installation/) page can be found here.

### Installation

Installation of EuroScope is easy. Just follow the instructions of the installer. Well, the only thing you should specify is the folder you would like to put the files in.

### Prerequisites

Before installing EuroScope v3.2.4 and later be sure to download and install the latest C++ redistributable package from Microsoft: https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x86.exe

## VATPHIL Updater

### Logging In

When you open the updater, you will be prompted to log in with your VATSIM account.

1. Click **Login with VATSIM** — your browser will open the VATSIM SSO page.
2. Approve the login in your browser.
3. The app will detect the login automatically and bring you to the main screen.

> **Note:** Only controllers authorised by the Philippines vACC staff will be granted access. If you see a "CID not authorised" error and you are an active controller, please contact vACC staff.

### Selecting an Installation Folder

Before installing, you need to point the updater to a folder where your sector files will live.

1. Click **Browse Folder**.
2. Navigate to any location on your computer (e.g. your EuroScope directory).
3. The updater will automatically create a **VATPHIL Sector** subfolder inside your chosen location.

> **Tip:** The updater remembers your folder between sessions — you only need to do this once.

### Installing / Updating Sector Files

Once a folder is selected, the updater checks the remote files against your local install.

| Status | Button shown | What it means |
|---|---|---|
| Not installed | **Install Update** | No local files found |
| Update available | **Install Update** | New AIRAC available |
| Up to date | **Selective Repair** / **Reinstall** | Files match the latest release |

Click **Install Update** to begin. A progress bar at the bottom of the status card will track the download. The sector profile is updated automatically to match the new AIRAC cycle once the install completes.

### Entering Your Controller Details

After installing, fill in the **Controller Details** panel in the left sidebar:

| Field | What to enter |
|---|---|
| **Name** | Your full name |
| **VATSIM CID** | Your VATSIM CID (pre-filled from VATSIM login) |
| **VATSIM Password** | Your VATSIM network password |
| **Hoppie ACARS Code** | Your personal Hoppie logon code (optional) |

Click **Apply** when done. EuroScope is ready to connect immediately.

> **Warning:** Your VATSIM password is saved locally in `config.json` next to the updater. Do not share this file with anyone.

### Selective Repair

If only specific files are missing or corrupted, use **Selective Repair** instead of a full reinstall.

1. Click **Selective Repair**.
2. A window will appear listing all remote files. Missing or outdated files are pre-checked and highlighted in red.
3. Use the search bar to filter files by name if needed.
4. Check any additional files you want to re-download, then click **Repair Selected**.

---

### Full Reinstall

**Reinstall** re-downloads every file from scratch. Use this if your installation is in an inconsistent state or you want a completely clean install.

1. Click **Reinstall** and confirm when prompted.
2. All existing files will be deleted and re-downloaded from the server.

---

### Keeping the Updater Itself Up to Date

The updater checks for a new version of itself each time you log in. If a newer version is available, you will be prompted to download and install it. The app restarts automatically once the update is applied — no manual steps required.
