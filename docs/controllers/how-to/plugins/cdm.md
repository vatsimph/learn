# Collaborative Decision Making (CDM)

On VATSIM, CDM is a tool that encourages virtual pilots & controllers to coordinate more effectively - much like in the real world, but adapted for an online flight simulation environment. By sharing essential departure data, planning collaborative push-back times, and adhering to consistent procedures, CDM helps to reduce airfield congestion and improve overall traffic flow. The result is a more immersive, realistic, and seamless experience for everyone involved in the virtual aviation community.

| Time | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| EOBT | The departure time entered by the pilot on the flightplan, not useful for VATSIM as this is normally inaccurate. |
| TOBT | When the aircraft aims to push back. |
| TSAT (Target start approval time) | When ATC plans to approve start, considering flow restrictions, taxi times, capacity etc. |
| ASRT (Actual start up time) | The time at which the pilot requests start. |
| TTOT (Target takeoff time) | When the A-CDM system estimates the aircraft will be airborne. |
| CTOT (Calculated takeoff time) | Also known as a "slot". The aircraft must depart -5/+10 minutes of this time. |
