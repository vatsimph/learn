# Visual Flight Rules (VFR)

Is a set of regulations under which a pilot operates an aircraft in generally clear weather conditions that allows the pilot to maintain visual contact to his/her surroundings. While there are minimum daylight, visibility, and cloud distance requirements in the real world, as the weather can be changed in the sim, said minimum criteria for VFR flights are relaxed in the VATSIM Network. However this does not reduce the responsibilities of the pilot-in-command. The pilot-in-command still must be able to see outside the cockpit to control the aircraft's altitude, navigate and find visual reference points, avoid obstacles and other aircraft. 

## General rules for VFR

In the Philippine airpsace, VFR flights shall not be operated above FL200 (or other defined lower limit of Class A airspace) and shall not be flown at transonic and supersonic speeds.

When cruising level of a VFR flight is above 3000 feet, the tables in the [RVSM](rvsm.md) page shows the valid VFR cruising altitudes.
