# Visual Flight Rules (VFR) Within Manila TMA

1. All VFR aircraft must be able to tune to frequencies in the VATSIM network, including, but not limited to:
    1. 121.800 MHz (RPLL_GND)
    2. 118.100 MHz (RPLL_TWR)
    3. 124.400 MHz (RPLL_F_APP)
    4. 124.800 MHz (RPLL_APP)
    5. 119.300 MHz (MNL_CTR)

2. Prior entering designated VFR areas, contact RPLL_TWR on 118.100 MHz
3. Adhere to established Manila VFR arrival/departure routings
4. Maintain not above 1500 FT within 10 NM from RPLL, not above 2500 FT within 10 - 15 NM from RPLL
5. When intending to transit the IFR climb/descend areas, contact Manila Approach on 124.400 (RPLL_F_APP), 124.800 MHz (RPLL_APP) or 119.300 MHz (MNL_CTR) for the necessary clearance.
6. All VFR aircraft inside the Manila Control Zone (CTR) must maintain listening watch with RPLL_TWR or higher controller up to the exit points
7. All VFR aircraft outside the Manila CTR but inside Manila TMA must maintain listening watch with RPLL_F_APP or higher controller
8. All arriving VFR flights shall initiate contact and remain on listening watch thereafter with RPLL_TWR upon entering Manila CTR
9. Any deviation from departure / arrival procedures shall have prior approval from RPLL_TWR or higher controller
10. All runway threshold or approach path crossing shall have explicit clearance from RPLL_TWR or higher controller.
