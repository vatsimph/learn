# Flight Routings

## Semi-Circular Cruising Level

If your destination is going to the **west**, you should file an even flight level (FL300, FL320,
FL340, etc).
If your destination is going to the **east**, you should file an odd flight level (FL310, FL330,
FL350, etc).

## Flights going through Hong Kong FIR and Singapore FIR

## Common Routing Mistakes
When filing a flight plan, the route is expected to start with a TMA exit. If a TMA exit is not provided, it will be invalid.

The TMA exits in Manila are as follows: **AL, BETEL, BUCAL, CAB, CONDE, ESCAN, ALPAS,
JOM, IBAGO, LAIYA, LBG, NATIB, OLIVA, SIRVA, TIMON, VERDE.**

There are some routes that start with **LIP**. Change it to **IBAGO** or **LAIYA** as LIP is **not considered as a TMA exit** and it will be conflicting with arrivals

# Pushing Back

When requesting for push and start, it is recommended for you to give your bay number for the
controller to easily find where you are.

Example: **“Manila Ground, Philippine 123 on bay 35, requesting push and start”**

Once you request for push and start, the controller will either clear you for it or let you hold at your
bay due to traffic. Clearances for push and start will include the runway that you can expect for
departure. The controller will not provide a pushback direction so it is recommended for you to push
to the direction where you will be facing the runway that you will be departing from.

Example: **“Philippine 123, push and start approved, runway 24. Advise when ready for taxi.”**

# Taxiing to the Runway
Taxi instructions can include, taxiways, runway crossings and hold short instructions. If you are departing for runway 06 or 24, there is a possibility where you will be crossing runway 31. Do not cross this runway unless you are instructed to do so.

If you are still unfamiliar with the taxiways, it is best to have your charts out to avoid any confusion.
Before requesting taxi, make sure that you have set your assigned code on your transponder and that you are squawking mode Charlie.

# Taking Off the Airport

IFR aircraft departing runway 06 or 24 will be instructed to maintain runway heading and climb
7000’ initially after departure. While for aircraft departing runway 13 or 31 will be instructed to
maintain runway heading and climb 3000’.

If radar services are available, do not turn or climb further unless you are instructed to do so. If radar
services are unavailable, you should only turn and climb further 3 minutes after you have departed.

If you wish to take an intersection departure, let the controller know since controllers will normally
give you a full length departure.

Controllers can also give you an immediate take off clearance. With this instruction, **DO NOT STOP.**
Once you are lined up, take off immediately and do not stop on the runway. There might be an
aircraft on final which might be some of the reasons why you are given an immediate take off
clearance.
