# Flight Routings

## Standard Instrument Departure (SID)
SIDs are not used in Manila if radar services are available (APP/CTR). However, you can still
request to use a SID if the controller will allow it. If radar services are not available, you will
be permitted to use a SID.

## Semi-Circular Cruising Level

If your destination is going to the **west**, you should file an even flight level (FL300, FL320,
FL340, etc).
If your destination is going to the **east**, you should file an odd flight level (FL310, FL330,
FL350, etc).

## Flights going through Hong Kong FIR and Singapore FIR

### Going to Hong Kong FIR
If you are flying through Hong Kong or will be flying to Hong Kong, you should have the
waypoints **NOMAN** or **SABNO**. Flights that will be passing through these waypoints from
Manila FIR is expected to file a flight level of FL300 / FL340 / FL380.

### Going to Singapore FIR
Flights going to Singapore should have the waypoint **TEGID**. Flights that will be passing
through this waypoint from Manila FIR is expected to file a flight level of FL310 / FL320 /
FL350 / FL360 / FL390 / FL400.

## Common Routing Mistakes
When filing a flight plan, the route is expected to start with a TMA exit. If a TMA exit is not
provided, it will be invalid.

The TMA exits in Manila are as follows: **AL, BETEL, BUCAL, CAB, CONDE, ESCAN, ALPAS,
JOM, IBAGO, LAIYA, LBG, NATIB, OLIVA, SIRVA, TIMON, VERDE.**

There are some routes that start with **LIP**. Change it to **IBAGO** or **LAIYA** as LIP is **not
considered as a TMA exit** and it will be conflicting with arrivals

# Getting your Clearance

On first contact with the controller that will issue your clearance, it is recommended for you to give
the following information:

- Your bay number
- Your aircraft type
- The ATIS information letter

Example: **“Manila Delivery, Philippine 123 on bay 35, Airbus 3-2-0, Information Alpha, requesting
clearance to Hong Kong”**

!!! warning

    Radio Checks on first contact is **discouraged** to use when building communication with the controller. It's best to greet or ask the controller, should you need any help before clearance issuance.

    The goal here is to be straightforward (Get to the point) and concise as possible when communicating within a controlled frequency. 

Once you have requested for clearance, the controller will either tell you to standby, or give your
clearance on the spot. Clearances include your routing, flight level restrictions, departure
instructions and your squawk.

Example: **“Philippine 123, cleared to Hong Kong via OLIVA W11 AVMUP A461 NOMAN flight
planned route, climb FL150 until further advised, runway heading on departure, expect radar
vectors to OLIVA. Squawk 1351”**

You must read back the clearance in full. Listen carefully to all details that the controller gives you,
and if you are unsure about your clearance, **let the controller know.**

# Pushing Back

When requesting for push and start, it is recommended for you to give your bay number for the
controller to easily find where you are.

Example: **“Manila Ground, Philippine 123 on bay 35, requesting push and start”**

Once you request for push and start, the controller will either clear you for it or let you hold at your
bay due to traffic. Clearances for push and start will include the runway that you can expect for
departure. The controller will not provide a pushback direction so it is recommended for you to push
to the direction where you will be facing the runway that you will be departing from.

Example: **“Philippine 123, push and start approved, runway 24. Advise when ready for taxi.”**

# Taxiing to the Runway
Taxi instructions can include, taxiways, runway crossings and hold short instructions. If you are
departing for runway 06 or 24, there is a possibility where you will be crossing runway 31. Do not
cross this runway unless you are instructed to do so.

If you are still unfamiliar with the taxiways, it is best to have your charts out to avoid any confusion.
Before requesting taxi, make sure that you have set your assigned code on your transponder and
that you are squawking mode Charlie.

# Taking Off the Airport

IFR aircraft departing runway 06 or 24 will be instructed to maintain runway heading and climb
7000’ initially after departure. While for aircraft departing runway 13 or 31 will be instructed to
maintain runway heading and climb 3000’.

If radar services are available, do not turn or climb further unless you are instructed to do so. If radar
services are unavailable, you should only turn and climb further 3 minutes after you have departed.

If you wish to take an intersection departure, let the controller know since controllers will normally
give you a full length departure.

Controllers can also give you an immediate take off clearance. With this instruction, **DO NOT STOP.**
Once you are lined up, take off immediately and do not stop on the runway. There might be an
aircraft on final which might be some of the reasons why you are given an immediate take off
clearance.
